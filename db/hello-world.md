_The very first post._

I have created this blog mostly as an experiment in coding, and I feel quite happy with how this turned out.  
I was able to learn some new libraries, try out **TypeScript** on my own (without other people in the project doing the harder stuff) and touch every part of the process: the idea, the (simple) design, code, and finally deployment.

That being said, since this is a blog, I wanted to share some of my thoughts related to the process of creating it.

## About the title
Current title is still a work in progress.

The general idea, a _motif_ if you will, that I wanted the title to include was this:
I have **so many thoughts** inside my head and my mind often wanders, thinking of the weirdest things in the weirdest moments of my life.

My interests are numerous, and include: tech, coding, psychology/cognitive sciences, physics, maths, pop culture, comic books, movies and cinema and many more. I'm unfortunately not really knowledgeable in all of those topics, I am however extremely interested in all of them.  
Because of that there is no single idea, thing, or topic which I could base the name off. I didn't really want a catchy one word title and I couldn't come up with anything witty or awesome.  
I wanted something that groups all this together.

### Some other ideas
  - _thoughts in my head_
  - _things in my head_
  - _stuff in my head_

These seemed either too simple _(thoughts)_ or too silly sounding _(stuff)_. So I settled for a simple "_worlds in my head_".

It's quite possible that I will change this in future.


## About the design
I'm not very good at coming up with graphic designs and UI. The most important thing for me was for the layout of this blog to be extremely clean and simple.  
Content is most important, and the rest should just enhance the content and make it easy to read. Also I wanted to make sure this looks good on all screen sizes.

The main resource I used was this awesome interactive article that I found:

[web design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/)

This has served as the backbone of the styling and helped me make sure that the thing was clean and readable.  
In general I tried to keep the amount of style rules to a minimum.

In addition my main inspiration for this was Dan Abramov's blog - [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/).

## About the tech

You can read all about the technical details in the `README` for this project on my github:
